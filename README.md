# WASD-Mac-Layout
## This is an updated WASD custom keyboard layout for Mac computers.
## Based on https://github.com/ychw/CustomMacKeycaps

I made several edits to improve (in my opinion) the layout, centering, line thickness, sizing of icons to my liking.

When I placed my order for my WASD Keyboard, I was told it was done on an older template, and a lot of things didn't line up. So this file is based on the new template.

Feel free to fork it, change it, improve it, or just use it to order your own custom WASD keyboard for your Mac.

## How To
1. Download the .ai file from this repository.
2. Modify it to fit your needs.
3. Go to your WASD and create a keycap set or custom keyboard based on the .ai file. Use WASD Keyboard as an example, just go to [this page](http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/index.php/products/keycap-set/104-key-cherry-mx-keycap-set.html) and upload your .ai file.
4. You need to map the keys to the labeled functions. Use [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) for that.
5. I will upload my configuration file once I get my keyboard and map all the keys.
