# WASD-Mac-Layout
This is an updated WASD custom keyboard layout for Mac computers.
Based on https://github.com/ychw/CustomMacKeycaps
I made several edits to improve the layout, centering, line thickness, sizing of icons to my liking.
When I placed my order for my WASD Keyboard, I was told it was done on an older template, so this file is based on the new template.
Feel free to fork it, change it, improve it, or just use it to order your own custom WASD keyboard for your Mac.
